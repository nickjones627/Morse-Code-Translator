This is a Morse to English / English to Morse translator that I created.

	It is important to note when translating Morse to English, that you must separate each character with a space ' ' and for the
space bar you use '/'.

	Example:
		".... . .-.. .-.. --- / .... . .-.. .-.. ---" will output as "HELLO HELLO". Feel free to fact check that with my program:)
